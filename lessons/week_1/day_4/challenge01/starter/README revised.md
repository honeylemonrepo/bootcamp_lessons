# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

### change log

* Changed <title> elements in html <head> for better search engine results;
* Removed most of confusing <div> and replaced with the relevant html semantic elements such as <section> <nav> and <figure> for a more clearer and accessible code structure;
* Added 'alt' attributes for all image and icon elements, so that a text based reference is available when the image and icon are no longer available and also for screen reader;
